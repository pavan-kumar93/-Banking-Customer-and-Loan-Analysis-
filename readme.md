\*\*\* Banking Customer \& Loan Analysis \*\*\*
An end-to-end data analytics project using SQL, Python, and Power BI to analyze banking customer behavior, financial risk, and product usage.



\*\*\* Objective

To identify high-value customer segments, evaluate risk vs. loyalty patterns, and analyze loan and deposit performance for data-driven banking insights.



\*\*\* Tools Used \*\*\*

* SQL (MySQL) – Core data analysis
* Python (Pandas, NumPy) – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Power BI – Interactive dashboards and reporting



\*\*\* Key Analysis Performed \*\*\*

* Customer wealth analysis by Occupation and Income Band
* Risk vs. Loyalty evaluation (Platinum vs. Jade customers)
* Credit card utilization using debt-to-income ratios
* Branch-level business lending performance
* Identification of high-value multi-product customers



\*\*\* Key Insights \*\*\*
\*Insights from SQL Analysis\*

* Medium-income professionals in technical, finance, and healthcare roles hold the highest total assets.
* Platinum loyalty customers show the lowest risk scores, while Jade customers exhibit higher credit risk.
* Australians have the highest debt-to-income ratio, while Asian and African customers show healthier credit behavior.
* High-income IT professionals, engineers, and accountants demonstrate high liquidity and multi-product usage.



\*\*\* Insights from Power BI Dashboard \*\*\*

* Business Lending ($2.6bn) is the primary revenue driver, outperforming individual bank loans.
* 53% of total financial activity is concentrated in the Medium income band.
* European customers form the largest demographic segment with near 50/50 gender parity.
* A 0.46 correlation between savings and checking balances indicates strong cross-product engagement.



\*\*\* What This Project Demonstrates \*\*\*

* Ability to translate business questions into SQL-based analysis
* Strong understanding of customer segmentation and financial metrics
* Hands-on experience with Python EDA
* Dashboard storytelling using Power BI



\*\*\* How to Run \*\*\*
